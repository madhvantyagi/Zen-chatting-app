    showing the stastics of the users who intrested in you, privacy chatting and video calling, different levels,
    programming api to help with codes and so much else ...



### Technologies

      Back-End: NodeJS, ExpressJS (BackEnd Framework), Socket.io (for P2P messaging), webRTC(Real Time Commmunication for Video,
                PeerJS, OpenCV), other technologies can be used too.

    }

## We will break the Application in 3 Major Stages:

    {
      {
        First: Basic UI(have login options, chatting space, profile page, ...) backed by Database for chatting BackEnd.
      },

      {

        Second: [ Better UI (colors, amazing effects, good responsiveness, real-time animations , easy to understandUI) 
                  adding video calling functionality, statistical properties , private chat(no DB), **record(video calls)LAST TO DO** ]  

      },

      {
        Third: much more to do in this .......
      }
    }
